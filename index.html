            you want to influence those around you in a way that improves your
            reputation?
            <p>
              Do you want to be understood and remembered? Would you like to be
              highly respected and for people to act on what you’ve said after
              meeting you in person. Would you like to be able to tell a
              compelling story or give a speech that has your audience hooked?
              Maybe your needs are a little more human and lower key…maybe you’d
              like more confidence, to be more approachable and likeable and to
              influence other people in a way that generates warmth, admiration
              and connection…

              For the last 20 years Nick Smallman, has been showing people all
              over the world how to develop their Charisma, Gravitas and
              Presence. These are the essential attributes of all highly
              successful people, and his executive coaching will give you these
              skills.
            </p>
            <b>A different coaching method</b>
            <p>
              A lot of executive coaching fails because the client is told what
              to do and to replace their current methods and technique.
              Unfortunately, human beings are creatures of habit and insecurity.
              Usually, we all revert to old behaviours, so the new way gets
              lost.
            </p>
            <b>Reorganising the mind</b>
            <p>
              Nick will show you how to become an extraordinary speaker and
              communicator by using a series of psychological techniques that
              once employed and embedded, strengthen your ability over time.
              Good coaching is about changing your mind on a fundamental level
              rather than showing you what to do. Real growth is psychological.
              The physical will follow. He will teach you techniques not by
              telling you what to do but instead by giving you solutions that
              embed themselves in your thinking. Over time, many of the things
              you thought were beyond possibility become easy and natural.
